Be food sustainable with a couple of clicks! Just input what food items you have available, and this app will tell you what recipes you can try out with those items. Colourful and fun and interactive. (Hopefully) text-to-speech device friendly.

How to use: run python app.py in the console, and then visit localhost:5000 to find out what you can make with eggs and bell peppers.
